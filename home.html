      <div class="">
        <p id="text-1">A while back, my co-founders and I had a vision for the parkour community. We were disappointed by the lack of free educational resources for students of parkour and we knew we needed to we find a solution. A couple of coffee-fueled long nights and traceur meetups later, ChanAcademy was born.</p>
        <p id="text-2">ChanAcademy is the Internet's hub for parkour instruction. With a focus on safety, fundamentals, and personal improvement, our goal is to make parkour the world's most beloved sport.
        Using our platform's tiered educational tracks geared for novices, professionals, and everyone in between, you won't ever be at a loss for training and finding your next biggest challenge.</p>

      <!--Evolving from military obstacle-course training, parkour is a modern physical activity focused on efficient movement through one's environment. Participants - called traceurs - run, climb, and vault through urban settings in creative yet practical ways.
      With its rising popularity in movies, video games, and online media, parkour has gone mainstream over the last decade. It is not uncommon to see viral videos of intense action sequences. Despite the risky looking maneuvers, the sport places a great emphasis on safety, personal responsibility, and self-improvement.
      An other name commonly ascribed to the sport is freerunning, which although developed in parallel with parkour, follows a different philosophy. Rather than going for speed and efficiency, practitioners of freerunning instead incorporate more artistic flips and tricks.-->
